Active Directory is a software that allow you to manage resources like computers and printers within a network. It is a centralized system for network administrators to manage and store information about resouces and users on a network. Here is demonstration of me setting up a Domain Controller (DC-1) machine and Windows 10 (Client-1) machine in Microsoft Azure to begin setting up Active Directory.

When using Wizard to install Active Directory checks are done to see if the server meets the necessary requirements to become a Domain Controller. The Wizard checks operating system version, network configuration and hardware specification. This is a demonstration of me Using Wizard to install Active Directory.

Power Shell ISE Stands for Power Shell Integrated Scripting Environment. It is a scripting tool provided by Microsoft to write and edit Power Shell scripts. It provide a great environment for writing, editing and debugging capabilities. This is an example of me creating users in Active Directory Domain Controller using Power Shell ISE.
